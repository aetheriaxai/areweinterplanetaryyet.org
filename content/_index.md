### The audacious [IPFS][] protocol stands for InterPlanetary File System, but when will it actually be used in Space?

The first confirmed mission to use IPFS (well, actually [IPFS-tiny][]) is a QUBIK pico-satellite made
by the fine folks at the [LibreSpace Foundation][], launching to Low-Earth Orbit in 2022

Watch this space for more updates soon -- we have big plans!
